<h1>Spam Email Classification</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building a binary classification model to identify spam emails. The notebook, <code>Binary_Classification-Spam_Email.ipynb</code>, demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using machine learning techniques.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content. The dataset used in this project consists of email samples labeled as "spam" or "ham" (not spam).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To run the notebook locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The following Python packages are also required:</p>

<ul>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
    <li>nltk</li>
    <li>matplotlib</li>
    <li>seaborn</li>
</ul>

<p>You can install these packages using pip:</p>

<pre><code>pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classification.git</code></pre>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
    <pre><code>cd spam-email-classification</code></pre>
    <li>Open the Jupyter Notebook:</li>
    <pre><code>jupyter notebook Binary_Classification-Spam_Email.ipynb</code></pre>
    <li>Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.</li>
</ol>
